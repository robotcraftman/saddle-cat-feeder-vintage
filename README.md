🐱 About the Project

This project explores a unique fusion between old-world craftsmanship and modern robotics.
Inspired by the shape, material, and spirit of traditional artisan saddles, this feeder is designed to look like it came from a rural workshop in the early mechanical era — yet powered by contemporary electronics.

A sculptural object, not just a device.

🎨 Design Philosophy

“Old materials, new engineering.”

This feeder draws heavily from:
	•	Vintage leather saddles
	•	Rugged rural craftsmanship
	•	Rough textures and earthy tones
	•	Hand-shaped curves and structural ribs
	•	Minimalism from early 20th-century tools

While integrating:
	•	Modern sensors
	•	Servo/stepper mechanisms
	•	Microcontroller logic
	•	Optional AI module for detection

# Outdoor Cat Feeder – Fusion 360 Prototype

This repository documents the development of a **real, manufacturable outdoor cat feeder prototype**, designed primarily in **Autodesk Fusion 360**.

Fusion 360 is used here as an **engineering tool**, not just for visualization.

---

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to design a **mechanically reliable and sellable cat feeder**, with emphasis on:

- Robust outdoor operation  
- Clear mechanical architecture  
- Serviceable and modular design  
- Real-world manufacturability  

This repository supports future monetization through:
- Design files
- Prototypes
- Small-batch builds or kits

---

## Fusion-Centric Approach

All core design work is done in **Fusion 360**, including:

- Parametric enclosure modeling  
- Hopper geometry with >50° anti-bridging slopes  
- Dedicated motor chamber design  
- Bearing-supported vertical shaft layout  
- Auger (spiral feeder) geometry  
- Assembly-aware clearances and interfaces  

Real hardware dimensions (motor, shaft, bearing) are **measured with digital calipers** and used directly in the CAD model.

Fusion models are treated as the **source of truth**.

---

## Current Status

**Phase:** Mechanical prototype (Fusion 360)

Completed:
- Overall enclosure envelope
- Hopper and feeding geometry
- Motor chamber sizing
- Shaft, bearing, and auger architecture

In progress:
- Motor mounting details
- Bearing support refinement
- Auger optimization
- Access and sealing features

---

## Planned

- Finalize motor mounting and bearing support geometry in Fusion 360  
- Complete auger optimization and outlet interface  
- Design access covers and basic sealing features  
- Prepare first manufacturable prototype (3D-print oriented)  
- Export Fusion models for prototyping and documentation
📌 Project Status

Current stage:
✅ Mechanical core – Auger (screw feeder) Version 0 completed
🕒 System integration in progress

This repository documents the project incrementally, starting from the most critical mechanical element.

🔧 What has been designed so far

Auger (Screw Feeder) – Version 0

The auger is the core feeding mechanism, responsible for actively transporting dry cat food.
	•	Single-flight screw auger
	•	Central shaft with continuous helical blade
	•	Designed and verified in Autodesk Fusion 360
	•	Geometry is parametric and editable

This version focuses on:
	•	Correct mechanical principle
	•	Stable rotation
	•	Clear structure

No optimization or industrial tuning yet.

⸻

📐 Current auger parameters (working values)
	•	Auger outer diameter: ~30 mm
	•	Shaft diameter: ~5 mm
	•	Number of turns: 8
	•	Blade thickness: 2.5 mm
	•	Type: Single-flight auger

These values are functional placeholders, suitable for early prototyping and iteration.

⸻

🧠 Design philosophy

This project follows a mechanics-first approach:
	•	Start with parts that must work physically
	•	Avoid adding complexity too early
	•	Each version must be understandable and testable

If the mechanism cannot work, aesthetics do not matter.

Advanced elements (bearings, couplings, housing, electronics, power system) are intentionally excluded at this stage.

🛠 Tools used
	•	Autodesk Fusion 360 (Educational License)
	•	Coil (Helix) tool for auger generation
	•	GitHub for design documentation
