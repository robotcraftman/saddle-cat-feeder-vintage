🐱 About the Project

This project explores a unique fusion between old-world craftsmanship and modern robotics.
Inspired by the shape, material, and spirit of traditional artisan saddles, this feeder is designed to look like it came from a rural workshop in the early mechanical era — yet powered by contemporary electronics.

A sculptural object, not just a device.

🎨 Design Philosophy

“Old materials, new engineering.”

This feeder draws heavily from:
	•	Vintage leather saddles
	•	Rugged rural craftsmanship
	•	Rough textures and earthy tones
	•	Hand-shaped curves and structural ribs
	•	Minimalism from early 20th-century tools

While integrating:
	•	Modern sensors
	•	Servo/stepper mechanisms
	•	Microcontroller logic
	•	Optional AI module for detection
